Evaluating articles for word quality (measured by use-frequency of words in article).  

The goal of this project is to write an R script that will evaluate how "pretty" news articles are by how frequently the words in those articles are used, a metric found from the repository file `count_1w.txt`, which was taken from [Peter Norvig's website](http://norvig.com/ngrams/).  

Let's see how this goes!
